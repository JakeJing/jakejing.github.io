This visualization explores the distribution of world languages based on the [Asher & Moseley (2007)](https://www.routledge.com/Atlas-of-the-Worlds-Languages/Asher-Moseley/p/book/9781315829845?srsltid=AfmBOor_QJOYhGh2ND2aaCP14OHbOHhJ6rOLfgAAPqPPf8vpS-rTtzBN) Atlas of the World's Languages. This visualization builds upon the recent work of [Ranacher et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-05828-6), who created a global and interoperable dataset of linguistic distributions derived from the Atlas of the World's Languages. Each polygon represents a geographic area where a specific language is spoken. Two maps are shown for each language: one for the traditional speaker areas and one for the contemporary speaker areas.

The full interactive visualization is available as a standalone HTML file. You can view it here:
